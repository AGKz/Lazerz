Lazerz
======

Greetings fellow earthlings!

Just one mining lazer is simply not enough! Thats the main idea behind the Lazerz Add-on to IC2.

TODO List:
1) Finish guis to new lazerz
2) Add Sound Effects
3) Create functional config

FUTURE RELEASES: Future things I want to add
- One word: Horses. More specificly? Horses with lasers
- Laser stand/base: Automated lasers!
- Laser Minecart with custom rail
- Helmet: Mining laser, now handsfree!

MODELS AND TEXTURES: In the need of a lazer stand model. Feel free to contact me

Custom Mining Laser Model by HoopAWolf. THANKS!


This is still very much WIP. At this moment there are no downloads becuase I am only like 1/2 way done with what I want to get done before release.
Look for a beta soon(ish)


Thats 'bout it! Check back often! (Pronounced without the t. off-in)

Current IC2 Build versions:

API Experimental: 2.0.271
Built with IC2 2.0.271 as external resource
