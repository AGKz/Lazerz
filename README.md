Lazerz
======

Greetings fellow earthlings!

Just one mining lazer is simply not enough! Thats the main idea behind the Lazerz Add-on to IC2.

TODO List:
1) Add guis to new lazerz
2) Work on lazer functionality
3) Add lazer stand
4) Create functional config

TEXTURES: I have created a few basic textures, but honestly, they are terrible. If you think you could do better, PLEASE
talk to me! I will give you credit and all that stuff.

This is still very much WIP. At this moment there are no downloads becuase I am only like 1/4 way done with what I want to get done before release.
